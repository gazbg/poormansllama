# Generic prefill layer residency — executable backlog (live tasks only)

SPLIT 2026-09-20: the 18 closed/completed task blocks moved VERBATIM to
`docs/plans/generic-prefill-layer-residency-archive.md` (mechanical record:
docs/plans/archive-manifest.json, including the byte-exact reconstruction check).
RESPLIT 2026-09-21: the blocks closed since then (T-GPLR-39, T-GPLR-50,
T-GPLR-51) moved to the archive the same way; mechanical record:
docs/plans/resplit-manifest-2026-09-21.json
(python tools/resplit-gplr-plan.py --verify re-proves the CURRENT state;
the 2026-09-20 tool's --verify is historical and no longer applies).
This file holds ONLY live work (in-progress or draft). Index of archived
blocks (original order preserved in the archive):
- ### T-GPLR-25: PP eviction prefetch-overlap prototype (device-side copy overlap in layer-major PP)
- ### T-GPLR-26: Gate-eligibility decision recording — binding vs advisory (item 4 brief)
- ### T-GPLR-27 (CLOSED — DEFERRED 2026-09-18 by owner decision): Second-architecture first pass — dense target (item 6 brief)
- ### T-GPLR-29: Pinned-pool probe — measure the true pinned H2D ceiling vs the direct-copy path
- ### T-GPLR-32: WDDM DMA-inflation serialization — one H2D in flight at a time (af worker DMA gate)
- ### T-GPLR-33: Member-batched submission — one submission per bank (91 -> ~44-58 ms window)
- ### T-GPLR-35: PP staging overlap — bank DMAs on a second stream inside the compute context (warm 4k ~2.75-2.8 -> ~2.0-2.1 s)
- ### T-GPLR-36: Long-context PP residual — what is the ~10 s that is neither compute nor engine time?
- ### T-GPLR-38: ubatch sweep on the 4k anchor — does fewer, fatter launches buy wall time under the current best mode?
- ### T-GPLR-31: Locked-RAM probe — does the driver grant a full-pool-size pinned allocation on this box?
- ### T-GPLR-30: Partial persistent pinned pool — warm-wall savings curve vs RAM cost
- ### T-GPLR-28: In-process layer-major PP repeat — first-touch mechanism experiment
- ### T-GPLR-44: per-graph patch scoping - stop restoring the whole pw set's inputs on every launch
- ### T-GPLR-45: drop the zero-consumer orphan from the patch restore - stop memcpy-ing the framework's pruned inp_embd on every launch
- ### T-GPLR-46: the pass-2 compute regression is REAL and rebuild-linked - isolate the trigger and the growth law
- ### T-GPLR-47: rebuild graph sets into a FRESH context (swap-in-slot), fixing the pass-2 regression and the T-GPLR-44 stale-pointer hazard at the root
- ### T-GPLR-48: make --pp-prebuild-per-pass KV-conditional (default ON only for quantized KV) per the T-GPLR-46 owner decision
- ### T-GPLR-49: fix the layer-major act-slab offset formula - bf16 element size and the chunk-0 cursor inheritance
- ### T-GPLR-39 (draft): make the `other` ledger bucket chunk-independent — the residue that grows with ubatch size
- ### T-GPLR-50 (draft): make the f16 rebuild default follow the charter shape — ON where the pass-2 excess is measured (flip the T-GPLR-48 f16 default back to ON)
- ### T-GPLR-51 (draft): attack the EXPOSED transfer at the charter shape - copy-tail and hiding robustness at 200k
- ### T-GPLR-37: direct mmap-sourced staging — remove the CPU hop from bank staging
- ### T-GPLR-52 (draft): attribute the shape-dependent per-copy staging cost (identical bytes, 18x wall) and correct the T-GPLR-51 copy-tail framing
- ### T-GPLR-54: single-chunk prefill identity - is the u4096 7-id tail insertion a numerics tie-break or a 1-chunk shape defect? (falsifiable ID-CHECK + a logit-margin discriminator)

Rules (same convention as the currentstate split, AGENT_ENVIRONMENT.md):
- Closed tasks are archived, never edited in place; a new closure appends its RESULT
  in the live file first, and the block moves to the archive on the NEXT split
  (python tools/resplit-gplr-plan.py --apply, which also refreshes the index).
- The archive's 6-line header is not original bytes; strip it when reconstructing.
