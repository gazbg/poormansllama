# Current State

Status: T-Q38LS-01, T-Q38LS-02 (one-layer execution boundary),
T-Q38LS-03 (full one-slot dense streaming prefill), T-Q38LS-04 (four-slot
persistent-graph PP), T-Q38LS-04B (per-variant persistent graph sets),
T-Q38LS-05 (PP-to-TG transition), and T-Q38LS-06 (evidence-only profiling
record) done. ALL batch-major plan tasks (T-Q38LS-01 through T-Q38LS-06) are
complete. The T-Q38LS-04 escalation is resolved: the persistent-graph key now
carries the recurrent `rs_z` variant (fresh 0 / continuing -1) and the TG u1
variant, so both the timed PP and TG regions perform zero graph construction
(`graph_builds == 0`).

Layer-major follow-up (docs/plans/qwen38-pp20k-plan.md): T-Q38LM-01 (stable
layer-major activation slices) and T-Q38LM-02 (full two-chunk layer-major PP
pass) are done. T-Q38LM-01 adds the opt-in `--pp-schedule layer-major` path,
two stable full-prompt activation slabs with non-aliasing per-chunk slices
bound into per-chunk persistent graph sets, layer-major telemetry
(`schedule`, `act_slab_bytes`, `chunk`, `act_bind`), and host-validator
enforcement of per-layer ascending chunk order and non-aliasing slab binds.
T-Q38LM-02 drives all 1,024 PP tokens (two 512-token chunks) through all 64
layers in layer-major order via a dedicated `layer_major_pp` controller:
128 PP `layer_compute` events (chunk 0 then 1 per layer), exactly 64 PP
`copy_submit` events (each package copied once and reused across both chunks
under the same generation), `graph_builds == 0`, and a one-token TG
schedule-consistency check producing the same first greedy ID (286) under
batch-major and layer-major. T-Q38LM-03 (20K scale), T-Q38LM-04 (PP-to-3TG),
and T-Q38LM-05 (regression closure) are done. The free-GPU 20K trace records
2,560 PP computes, 64 PP package copies, `graph_builds == 0` for PP and TG,
and greedy IDs 317, 197, 197; host validation passes and the full 19-target
GPU regression suite passes. The T-Q38LS-07 batch-major 20K task remains
blocked/superseded by the layer-major design.

Facts below are observed evidence only. Superseded claims are removed, never
retained. The normative design is `docs/qwen38-layer-streaming-sdd.md`; the
executable backlog is `docs/plans/qwen38-layer-streaming-plan.md`; environment
facts live in `docs/AGENT_ENVIRONMENT.md`.

## 20K Layer-Major Evidence (done 2026-08-20)

The availability probe found 24,137 MiB free and 0 MiB used. The GPU mutex
protected `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File
tools/run-tests.ps1 -Suite pp20k-layer-major` exited 0 and wrote
`build/llama-cuda/q38ls-pp20k-layer-major.jsonl`; both `--check-telemetry` and
`--validate-telemetry` exited 0, producing the companion summary JSON.

- PP: 20,480 tokens / 40 chunks, 25,708.0 ms, 796.64 tok/s; 64 package copies,
  2,560 layer computes, 60 evictions, 23,111,182,336 bytes transferred,
  81,204.8 ms transfer, 0.5 ms availability wait, 17,752.6 ms compute, and
  `graph_builds == 0`.
- TG: 3 tokens, 7,630.3 ms, 0.39 tok/s; emitted IDs 317, 197, 197; 192
  evictions, 8,071.5 ms transfer, 17.1 ms availability wait, 270.8 ms
  compute, and `graph_builds == 0`. TG began from the live layer-major PP
  session; the validator accepted the PP-to-TG lifecycle without a slot reset.
- Preflight reported 22,922,919,936 free bytes of 25,650,855,936 total; two
  activation slabs used 838,860,800 bytes, and the 41 graph-set footprint
  contained 2,706 graphs. Peak VRAM was 8,247,640,064 bytes (7,865.56 MiB).
  The early PP layers had warmup-heavy transfer/compute totals; raw timings are
  recorded only as evidence, not as a speedup or quality claim.
- `tools/run-tests.ps1 -Suite all` then passed all 19 targets under the same
  mutex, including batch-major, layer-major, and the positive/negative 40-chunk
  lifecycle fixtures. The default-OFF `llama-cli` target had already rebuilt
  successfully. Default batch-major behavior remains unchanged and the
  layer-major path remains opt-in.

Caveats: this run had an idle GPU at start, but the mmap source remains
best-effort cold because Windows file-cache state is uncontrolled. No resident
baseline, quality evaluation, equivalence test, or speedup comparison was run.

## T-Q38PERF-01: copy timing split (done 2026-08-20)

`copy_complete` now carries additive `host_submit_us` and
`ready_latency_us` fields. Their sum equals the legacy `transfer_us` field;
the host telemetry checker rejects partial, negative, or inconsistent splits
when they are present while accepting historical fixtures without them. This
does not isolate DMA duration: `ready_latency_us` still includes copy-stream
queueing. The focused `layer-streaming-layer-major-1024` CUDA CTest passed
under the GPU mutex, followed by `--check-telemetry`; its first copy recorded
122.3 ms host submission, 344.2 ms ready latency, and 466.5 ms legacy
submit-to-ready transfer. The three host-only `layer-streaming-lm40` fixture
tests also passed. Default behavior and slot scheduling are unchanged.

## T-Q38PERF-02: package-class slot allocation (done 2026-08-20)

Slots now allocate only the recurrent and/or attention package classes served
by their logical-layer mapping. The representative tensor for each allocated
class is selected from a matching logical layer, which also fixes mixed-class
slot counts where the slot index itself can name an attention layer. For the
four-slot schedule, `slot_vram_bytes` fell from 2,853,972,608 to
1,444,448,896 bytes (1,409,523,712 bytes, or 1,344.2 MiB, saved). The focused
four-slot layer-major CTest passed. A new persistent five-slot mixed-class
runner-plus-checker fixture passed; its checker now derives each slot's actual
layer-cycle length, so it accepts uneven 64-layer distributions (12 or 13
layers per slot) while preserving the four-slot policy. Default behavior is
unchanged.

## T-Q38PERF-03: pinned-host package staging (done 2026-08-20)

The isolated runner now accepts `--copy-source direct|pinned` (default
`direct`) and records the selected value in `run_start.copy_source`. Pinned mode
gives each slot one CUDA-pinned host buffer sized to that slot's device package
allocation. It packs package tensors into the buffer before enqueueing the
existing asynchronous copies; the existing consumer-complete event protects the
buffer from reuse. Pinning failure or allocator fallback to ordinary host memory
fails initialization rather than silently changing copy behavior.

Paired mutex-protected 1,024-token layer-major traces at u-batch 512, four
slots, zero PP logits, and one greedy TG token both exited 0 and passed
`--check-telemetry` (837 events, four slots):
`build/llama-cuda/q38ls-direct-1024-paired.jsonl` and
`build/llama-cuda/q38ls-pinned-1024-paired.jsonl`. Pinned PP was 8,366.4 ms
(122.394 tok/s), versus direct 8,195.3 ms (124.950 tok/s). It reduced summed PP
host submission from 7,505.1 to 6,062.4 ms, but raised availability wait from
0.5 to 393.8 ms. Pinned TG was also slower (2,757.5 vs 2,515.0 ms), with
availability wait rising from 5.3 to 1,510.4 ms. This single paired observation
does not establish a speedup; pinned staging remains opt-in as an instrumented
experiment. After CMake reconfiguration, the mutex-protected
`layer-streaming-pinned-1024` CTest fixture passed its runner and host checker
(2/2, 17.90 s).

## T-Q38PERF-04: Q8_0 K/V cache (done 2026-08-20)

The isolated runner accepts `--kv-cache f16|q8` (default `f16`). Q8 mode sets
both `llama_context_params.type_k` and `type_v` to llama.cpp's native Q8_0
type before context creation; FlashAttention and cache-head compatibility remain
validated by the existing llama.cpp context constructor. Decoder weights, slot
ownership, and Gated DeltaNet recurrent state remain unchanged. `run_start`
now labels the selected `kv_cache` mode.

The mutex-protected feasibility trace
`build/llama-cuda/q38ls-q8-1024.jsonl` used `--no-mmap --kv-cache q8`, eight
slots, 1,024 layer-major PP tokens (two chunks), and one greedy TG token. It
exited 0; `--check-telemetry` accepted 833 events and eight slots. PP was
2,712.3 ms (377.545 tok/s), TG was 1,687.1 ms, and observed peak VRAM was
6,140,002,304 bytes (5,855.56 MiB). The focused default-F16
`layer-streaming-layer-major-1024` CTest also passed (2/2, 17.49 s). This
establishes Q8 cache lifecycle feasibility only; no output-quality,
equivalence, speed, or long-context capacity conclusion is made. The current
100K blocker remains the per-chunk host F32 mask allocation.

## T-Q38PERF-05: implicit causal PP mask feasibility (in progress 2026-08-20)

The opt-in layer-major Qwen3.8 PP path now represents causal visibility in
`GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_EXT` metadata (`q_pos_base`, `n_kv_valid`) rather than a
dense F16 mask. It is eligible only for causal FlashAttention with one
contiguous sequence, no SWA or ALiBi, and the CUDA MMA-compatible graph shape.
All other graphs, including TG, retain their dense-mask behavior. Layer-major
host input allocation omits per-chunk masks only when this capability is
explicitly enabled; remaining dense-mask budgeting uses `ggml_fp16_t` bytes.

`build/llama-cuda/q38ls-implicit-q8-1024.jsonl` is a direct-source, four-slot,
Q8 K/V, 1,024-token layer-major PP plus one-token TG trace. It emitted
`implicit_causal_mask: true`, exited 0, and `--check-telemetry` accepted all
837 events. Runner telemetry reports 1,444,448,896 bytes of slot VRAM and a
4,690,870,272-byte peak (4,473.56 MiB); these are run-scoped telemetry facts,
not a speed or capacity claim. CUDA `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` backend cases passed
2,922/2,922 comparisons, the default-F16 layer-major CTest passed 2/2, and
the mutex-protected `tools/run-tests.ps1 -Suite all` passed 24/24 in 518.51 s.

The first 40,960-token Q8 attempt exposed a separate linear host-input budget
defect after dense masks were removed: every persistent chunk graph owns the
optional F32 `inp_embd` created by `build_inp_embd`, but `buf_inputs` retained
only a fixed 64 MiB non-mask allowance. The bounds guard reported `inp_embd`
at offset 64,698,560 with size 10,485,760 in a 67,108,864-byte buffer. The
layer-major budget now adds one full-prompt F32 embedding allocation
(`n_embd_inp * pp_tokens * sizeof(float)`), which is 838,860,800 bytes for
40,960 tokens, while implicit mode still allocates no per-chunk dense masks.

The repaired mutex-protected trace
`build/llama-cuda/q38ls-pp40k-layer-major-q8.jsonl` processed 40,960 PP tokens
as 80 chunks with four slots, Q8 K/V, and `implicit_causal_mask: true`. It
exited 0; the independent checker accepted 1,055 events. Observed PP wall time
was 55,198.2 ms (742.053 tok/s), summed transfer was 164,931.191 ms, wait was
0.473 ms, summed compute was 47,643.858 ms, peak VRAM was 7,523.56 MiB, and
timed graph builds were zero. Excluding the 63.738 ms layer-0/chunk-0 first-use
event gives 47,580.120 ms summed compute. This is one shared-GPU feasibility
trace, not a generalized performance or quality claim. The focused default-F16
layer-major regression remained green (2/2, 16.73 s).

The backend harness currently proves CPU/CUDA agreement for the implicit
operation, but does not independently retain and compare the equivalent dense
causal output. T-Q38PERF-05 remains in progress until that direct oracle is
added. No long-context quality or equivalence conclusion is made.

## Completed

### T-Q38LS-01: reproducible CUDA experiment envelope (done 2026-08-18)

Commands (both from workspace root, Git Bash; compilation does not need the
GPU mutex):

1. `cmake -S third_party/llama.cpp -B build/llama-cuda -DGGML_CUDA=ON` ->
   exit 0. CUDA 13.2.51 toolkit, host compiler MSVC 19.50.35726.0, target arch
   `120a-real` (RTX 5090 / sm_120). OpenSSL 3.6.1 found. NCCL absent (warning
   only; single GPU, irrelevant).
2. `cmake --build build/llama-cuda --config Release --target llama-cli --parallel 16`
   -> exit 0. Artifact `build/llama-cuda/bin/Release/llama-cli.exe`.
3. `cmake --build build/llama-cuda --config Release --target llama-gguf --parallel 16`
   -> exit 0. Artifact `build/llama-cuda/bin/Release/llama-gguf.exe`.

Model identification evidence:
- `llama-gguf.exe "<model>" r` (llama.cpp's own reader): GGUF version 3,
  alignment 32, data offset 10,996,800, n_kv 51, n_tensors 866; `qwen35.*`
  KV keys present; per-tensor sizes verified (e.g. `blk.0.attn_qkv.weight`
  55,705,600 bytes). Full dump in the env guide.
- `llama-cli` under the GPU mutex (`tools/with-gpu-lock.ps1`) with
  `-ngl 8 -p hi -n 1`: model loaded and executed on CUDA. Banner reported
  `build b10493-04b569142`, model path, `modalities: text`. Prompt processed
  at 13.2 t/s (partial offload: 8/64 layers on GPU), one token generated.
  Log: `out/q38ls-ngl8-smoke.log`. Evidence that the CUDA runtime loads and
  runs this exact artifact.
- `llama-cli -ngl 0 -p hi -n 1` (CPU-only, no CUDA): did not complete within
  600 s and was killed (201 s CPU consumed). The CPU path is impractical for
  this 26 GB hybrid model; consistent with the CUDA-only experiment scope.

Quant facts (corrected during this task): `general.file_type = 14` maps to
llama.cpp enum `LLAMA_FTYPE_MOSTLY_Q4_K_S` whose display name is "Q4_K -
Small" - a legacy label that does not describe this file. Actual per-tensor
quants (this tree's ggml enum: F32=0, Q8_0=8, Q5_K=13, Q6_K=14):
`output.weight` Q8_0, `token_embd` Q6_K, `attn_qkv`/`ffn_down` Q8_0,
`ffn_gate`/`ffn_up` Q6_K, `ssm_alpha`/`ssm_beta` Q5_K, 1-D params F32. This
is the UD/Q6_K_XL dynamic scheme. Byte sizes measured from tensor offsets are
ground truth and are in the env guide (static 2.394 GB, recurrent package
364.0 MB max, full-attn package 352.4 MB max, four-slot window ~1.444 GB).

### T-Q38LS-02: one-layer Qwen3.8 execution boundary (done 2026-08-18)

Implementation (all gated by CMake option `LLAMA_LAYER_STREAMING`, default OFF):
- `src/llama-layer-streaming.{h,cpp}`: slot buffers + tensor bundles, persistent
  activation pair, persistent host input buffer, dedicated CUDA copy backend,
  per-slot CUDA events, JSONL telemetry, and the layer-by-layer executor
  (`llama_context::layer_streaming_compute`).
- `src/llama-graph.h`: `llm_graph_params.layer_streaming` (default nullptr).
- `src/models/qwen35.cpp` + `models.h`: layer-view indirection `layer(il)`
  (model.layers[il] normally, slot-bound bundle in streaming mode) and
  `build_streaming_graphs()` which produces one cgraph per piece: embed graph,
  64 per-layer graphs, output graph.
- `src/llama-context.{h,cpp}`: gated streaming branch in `process_ubatch`.
- `tools/layer-streaming/main.cpp`: runner (`llama-layer-streaming` exe) with
  boundary mode, PP, greedy TG, JSONL telemetry.

Validated evidence (commands from workspace root, GPU runs under
`tools/with-gpu-lock.ps1`):
- `cmake -S third_party/llama.cpp -B build/llama-cuda -DGGML_CUDA=ON
  -DLLAMA_LAYER_STREAMING=ON` and `cmake --build ... --target
  llama-layer-streaming` -> exit 0.
- OFF-build check: separate dir `build/llama-cuda-off` (no option) builds
  `llama-cli` -> exit 0 (default path unchanged; the only ungated change is a
  nullptr-initialized field in `llm_graph_params`).
- `ctest --test-dir build/llama-cuda -C Release -R qwen38-layer-boundary
  --output-on-failure` -> Passed (4.0 s).
- Boundary run: `llama-layer-streaming --model <env path> --layer-slots 1
  --boundary-layers 0,3 --pp-tokens 64 --ubatch 64 --no-mtp --telemetry
  out/q38ls-boundary.jsonl` -> exit 0. Recurrent layer 0 (Gated DeltaNet) and
  full-attention layer 3 both constructed and executed one-layer CUDA graphs.
  Telemetry: `out/q38ls-boundary.jsonl` (14 lines: run_start, per-layer
  slot_request/copy_submit/copy_complete/layer_ready_wait/layer_compute,
  phase_summary pp 64 tokens 205.7 tok/s, run_end exit 0). Copy byte counts
  match the env guide exactly: layer 0 364,022,656 B, layer 3 352,380,928 B.
  Peak VRAM 3.87 GiB during the boundary run (foreign process still resident).

Key measured behavior (one slot): the H2D copy from the pageable mmap source
blocks the host inside `cudaMemcpyAsync` (driver staging for pageable memory),
so per-layer wall is copy-then-compute with ~0 availability wait at
consumption; transfer_us (submit->complete) ~111 ms for the recurrent package
and ~104 ms for the full-attn package on this shared GPU. This is recorded as
observed behavior, not a defect or a claim.

### T-Q38LS-03: full one-slot dense streaming prefill (done 2026-08-18)

Command (GPU mutex; workspace root):
`powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/with-gpu-lock.ps1 -Command "<build>/bin/Release/llama-layer-streaming.exe --model C:/Models/ALL/other/qwen-3.8/Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q6_K_XL.gguf --pp-tokens 512 --ubatch 64 --layer-slots 1 --no-mtp --telemetry out/q38ls-t03.jsonl"`
-> exit 0. Log `out/q38ls-t03.log`, telemetry `out/q38ls-t03.jsonl` (3074 lines).

Measured results:
- PP: 512 tokens in 24,363.2 ms = 21.02 tok/s. 8 u-batches of 64 tokens.
- `phase_summary` (JSONL): tokens 512, ubatches 8, wall_us 24,363,220,
  tokens_per_s 21.015, bytes_transferred 184,889,458,688 (512 package copies
  x ~361 MB avg), evictions 511, total_transfer_us 23,391,879, total_wait_us
  43,900, total_compute_us 850,252, layers_run 64.
- Per-layer averages (over 8 executed u-batches): recurrent layer transfer
  ~45.4-53.2 ms + compute ~1.3-2.1 ms; full-attn transfer ~43.9-44.7 ms +
  compute ~1.4-2.1 ms; setup ~0.04-0.09 ms; wait ~0.08-0.10 ms. Copy bytes
  match the env-guide package inventory (recurrent 364,022,656 B,
  full-attn 352,380,928 B).
- CUDA0 compute buffer 188.64 MiB (matches expected), CUDA_Host 2.565 MiB.
  Peak VRAM 3.91 GiB.
- JSONL ordering verified: every `layer_compute` follows the matching
  generation's `copy_complete`; telemetry has 512 copy_submit/slot_request/
  copy_complete/layer_ready_wait/layer_compute pairs (8 ubatches x 64 layers)
  plus run_start/phase_summary/run_end.

Required validations:
- Runner command (above) -> exit 0 and eight PP u-batches in telemetry. Passed.
- `ctest --test-dir build/llama-cuda -C Release -R layer-slot-lifecycle
  --output-on-failure` -> Passed (30.9 s) under the GPU mutex.

Defect found and fixed during this task:
- Persistent graphs were corrupted on graph reuse: `ggml_backend_sched_alloc_graph`
  rewires node src pointers in place when introducing cross-backend copies, and
  `sched->ctx` is freed on the next split; re-splitting a reused graph then
  aliased stale rewired pointers with unrelated tensors (observed: embed cpy
  src degraded to a 64-elem token leaf -> `cpy.cu` element-count assert). Fix:
  the executor snapshots each graph's node src pointers before alloc and
  restores them after compute, keeping the persistent graphs pristine across
  u-batches. T-04/05 inherit this fix.

### T-Q38LS-04: four-slot persistent-graph PP streaming (done 2026-08-19)

Command (GPU mutex; workspace root):
`powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/with-gpu-lock.ps1 -Command "<build>/bin/Release/llama-layer-streaming.exe --model C:/Models/ALL/other/qwen-3.8/Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q6_K_XL.gguf --layer-slots 4 --pp-tokens 512 --ubatch 64 --no-mtp --telemetry out/q38ls-pp.jsonl"`
-> exit 0. Log `out/q38ls-pp.log`, telemetry `out/q38ls-pp.jsonl` (3071 lines).

Measured results (512-token trace):
- PP: 512 tokens in 26,540.0 ms = 19.29 tok/s. 8 u-batches of 64 tokens.
- `phase_summary`: tokens 512, ubatches 8, wall_us 26,539,954, tokens_per_s
  19.292, bytes_transferred 184,889,458,688, evictions 508,
  total_transfer_us 102,470,682, total_wait_us 2,159, total_compute_us 775,010,
  layers_run 64, graph_prep_us 2,046, graph_builds 1.
- Peak VRAM 6.04 GiB (vs 3.91 GiB for one slot). Four-slot window observed as
  expected (~2.85 GB of slot buffers reported at run_start).
- With four slots the pageable H2D copies now overlap the compute of the other
  slots; total_wait_us dropped to ~2.2 ms (from 43.9 ms at one slot) because a
  layer's copy is usually already complete when consumed. Transfer remains
  dominant (~99.8 GB accumulated copy time vs ~0.78 s compute); copies from the
  pageable mmap source still serialize on the copy stream.

Required validations:
- Runner command (above) -> exit 0 with all required PP event types. Passed.
- `ctest --test-dir build/llama-cuda -C Release -R layer-streaming-scheduler
  --output-on-failure` -> Passed (run 12.5 s + host-side invariant check
  0.1 s) under the GPU mutex. The check validates exactly n_slots distinct
  slots, `slot == layer % n_slots`, per-slot generation monotonicity,
  copy_submit -> copy_complete -> layer_ready_wait -> layer_compute ordering,
  prior-resident `slot_evict` identity, and `graph_builds == 0` on the 64-token
  single-ubatch run.
- Regression: `qwen38-layer-boundary` Passed (4.0 s), `layer-slot-lifecycle`
  Passed (30.4 s) under the GPU mutex. Default (OFF) `llama-cli` build still
  compiles.

Implementation notes:
- Added `llama_context_params.n_pad` (default 0 = unchanged). The runner sets
  `n_pad = n_ctx` so the KV cache pads `n_kv` to the full context for every
  ubatch, keeping all graph shapes constant across the whole session (the
  existing `get_n_kv` padding mechanism, now pinned to full width). Tradeoff:
  full-attention layers attend over the full padded width from the first
  ubatch; recorded, not claimed as an optimization.
- Added `llama_layer_streaming_prebuild()` (exported wrapper around
  `llama_context::layer_streaming_prebuild`) which splits the batch, applies
  the first ubatch (so graph shapes match), builds the 66 per-piece graphs
  before the PP timer, then `memory->clear(false)` releases the applied cell
  metadata so the timed decode starts from the identical fresh cell mapping.
- Persistent graph entries now carry explicit `(mode, logical_layer, slot)`
  keys and the executor fails loudly on any mode/layer/slot mismatch; slot
  generation is now in copy_complete/layer_ready_wait/layer_compute telemetry;
  `slot_evict` now reports the prior resident layer.
- Runner gains a host-side `--check-telemetry PATH` validator (no GPU/model)
  used by the scheduler CTest.

Resolved by T-Q38LS-04B (rs_z two-variant persistent-graph key):
- The Gated DeltaNet recurrent `rs_z` is 0 on the first PP ubatch (fresh state;
  the graph includes an in-graph zeroing of one state cell) and -1 on every
  continuing ubatch (zero-sized view). T-Q38LS-04B closes this: the graph cache
  is now keyed `(mode, n_tokens, rs_z)` with per-variant input tensors and result
  objects, and the prebuild builds all three variants (fresh-PP, continuing-PP,
  TG-u1) before the timed region. The 512-token/4-slot timed PP region now
  reports `graph_builds == 0` (pre-fix baseline was 1) and the 256-token
  four-ubatch run that crosses the rs_z 0 -> -1 transition also reports
  `graph_builds == 0`. See the T-Q38LS-04B section below.

### T-Q38LS-04B: per-variant persistent graph sets (done 2026-08-19)

Observed behavior
- The streaming module now owns per-variant graph sets keyed
  `(mode, n_tokens, rs_z)`. Each set owns its io context, activation region,
  input region, and `llm_graph_result`. The executor selects the set per ubatch
  by `(phase, n_tokens, rs_z)`, verifies the prebuilt input tensor shapes
  (mismatch fails loudly per SDD), writes inputs, and runs the set's piece
  graphs. `process_ubatch` bypasses the `gf_res_prev` reuse/build machinery in
  streaming mode; an on-demand build of an unprebuilt variant remains as a
  counted fallback.
- Prebuild builds variant A (fresh PP, rs_z 0), variant B (continuing PP,
  rs_z -1), and, when `--tg-tokens > 0`, variant C (TG u1, mode 1, rs_z -1),
  then `memory->clear(false)` releases all applied cell metadata so the timed
  decode starts from the identical fresh cache.

Validation evidence (Release, GPU mutex)
- `layer-streaming-pp512`: 512 tokens / 4 slots, 8 ubatches, `graph_builds == 0`,
  `wall_us ~25.6ms`, `total_transfer_us ~97.2ms`, `total_compute_us ~0.94ms`,
  `layers_run 64`. Host `--check-telemetry` passes.
- `layer-streaming-scheduler-256`: 256 tokens / 4 slots, 4 ubatches crossing the
  rs_z 0 -> -1 transition, `graph_builds == 0`. Host check passes.
- `layer-streaming-scheduler` (64-token), `qwen38-layer-boundary`,
  `layer-slot-lifecycle`: all pass. OFF build `llama-cli` compiles clean.

Root cause of the first GPU run's shape-guard failure (debugging record)
- The executor verified sets via `llm_graph_result::can_reuse`, whose
  `params.allow_reuse` half compares the stored prebuild `llm_graph_params`
  (dangling `mctx`/`sched`/`ubatch.data` pointers) against the live decode
  params, so it always failed despite every tensor shape matching (prebuild
  n_kv 256 == live n_kv 256, n_rs 1, rs_z 0, n_tokens 64). Fix: run each
  prebuilt input's own `can_reuse` (shape checks, which re-point the input mctx
  to the live context) and skip the stale-pointer params half. No SDD/plan
  boundary changed.

### T-Q38LS-05: PP-to-TG transition (done 2026-08-19)

Observed behavior
- TG (128 greedy tokens) begins immediately after PP with the exact four slot
  assignments and per-session state (KV + Gated DeltaNet) left by PP; no slot
  reset or host prewarm. The first TG layer-0 request finds slot 0 already
  resident from PP (generation 129, `ready_at_consumption true`, wait ~3us) -
  no wrap-around preload.
- The TG phase uses the prebuilt `tg_u1` graph set (mode 1, n_tokens 1, rs_z -1)
  built before the timer, so the timed TG region reports `graph_builds == 0`.
- 128 greedy token IDs are emitted in a `tg_tokens` JSONL event and
  `run_end.n_tokens_generated == 128`.

Validation evidence (Release, GPU mutex, 512 PP + 128 greedy TG / 4 slots)
- `layer-streaming-transition` (run + host check): pass; run ~345s.
- PP: 512 tok / 8 ubatches, `graph_builds 0`, ~19.8 tok/s, transfer ~98s, compute ~1.0s.
- TG: 128 tok / 128 ubatches, `graph_builds 0`, 0.41 tok/s, transfer ~1223s,
  compute ~9.6s; per-layer transfer/wait/compute present for all 64 layers.
- All PP-only scheduler/slot/boundary regressions pass; OFF build compiles clean.

Notes
- `reset_stats()` at the PP->TG boundary makes each `phase_summary` report its
  own phase's totals (previously cumulative, so TG double-counted PP).
- Per-layer copy/wait/compute telemetry now carries a `phase` field so TG events
  are distinguishable from PP events.
- `cparams.n_ctx`/`n_pad` round `pp+tg` up to a 256-multiple (640 -> 768) so
  `n_pad` divides `kv_size == n_ctx_seq`; the mask masks empty padded KV slots to
  -INF so the larger constant `n_kv` is safe.

### T-Q38LS-06: evidence-only profiling record (done 2026-08-19)

Reproducibility command (no GPU/model needed for validation)
- `build/llama-cuda/bin/Release/llama-layer-streaming --validate-telemetry <trace>.jsonl`
  -> exit 0, writes `<trace>.jsonl.summary.json` (the validated profile artifact).
- Source trace: `--model <Q6_K_XL.gguf> --layer-slots 4 --pp-tokens 512 --ubatch 64
  --tg-tokens 128 --greedy --no-mtp --telemetry <trace>.jsonl` (run via CTest
  `layer-streaming-transition`).

Validation result
- `--validate-telemetry` on the transition trace: exit 0, 52225 events, 4 slots,
  64 layers. `ctest -R layer-streaming-telemetry`: positive (writes summary) and
  negative (WILL_FAIL on missing/incomplete telemetry) both pass.

Profile artifact (q38ls-pp-tg.jsonl.summary.json) raw metrics
- PP: 512 tokens, ~7-20 tok/s (shared-GPU noise), transfer ~98-267s, wait ~4ms,
  compute ~1-2.3s, 64 layers, graph_builds 0.
- TG: 128 tokens, ~0.4 tok/s, transfer ~1.2s, wait ~62ms, compute ~9.3s,
  64 layers, graph_builds 0.
- peak_vram_bytes recorded; per-layer transfer/wait/compute min/mean/max for all
  64 layers per phase.
- Caveats recorded: source cache best-effort cold (uncontrolled Windows file
  cache); no speedup baseline was run; no quality/equivalence/speedup claim.

Manual test running + output (2026-08-19)
- `tools/run-tests.ps1 -Suite all|quick|boundary|telemetry` runs the CTest
  suites under the GPU mutex (`--output-always` prints every test's output).
  `-Suite telemetry` is host-only (no GPU, no lock).
- Every model run now self-checks its `--telemetry` trace at exit and prints a
  per-phase summary: tokens, tok/s, wall, total transfer/wait/compute, layers
  run, evictions, graph_builds, peak VRAM. `--check-telemetry <trace>.jsonl`
  prints the same summary for any existing trace (host-only).
- Note: `build/llama-cuda/q38ls-pp-tg.jsonl` must be regenerated by a fresh
  `layer-streaming-transition-run` (it was truncated by a killed mid-run test
  launch on 2026-08-19 and deleted).

### T-Q38LM-01: stable layer-major activation slices (done 2026-08-20)

Opt-in `--pp-schedule layer-major` path (default `batch-major`) proving that
two 512-token chunks can be driven through one selected logical layer while
retaining distinct, stable, full-prompt activation-slab ranges. Evidence only;
no quality/equivalence/speedup claim.

Commands (workspace root, Git Bash; GPU runs under `tools/with-gpu-lock.ps1`):
- Reconfigure with the model path baked into the CTest entries (the build had
  been reconfigured with an empty `Q38LS_MODEL_PATH`, which emptied every
  GPU test's `--model` arg): `export Q38LS_MODEL_PATH=
  C:/Models/ALL/other/qwen-3.8/Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q6_K_XL.gguf` then
  `cmake -S third_party/llama.cpp -B build/llama-cuda -DGGML_CUDA=ON
  -DLLAMA_LAYER_STREAMING=ON` -> exit 0.
- Build (no GPU): `cmake --build build/llama-cuda --config Release --target
  llama-layer-streaming --parallel 16` -> exit 0.
- Layer-major boundary probe (GPU mutex): `ctest --test-dir build/llama-cuda
  -C Release -R layer-streaming-lm-boundary-run --output-on-failure` (runner:
  `--pp-schedule layer-major --boundary-layers 0 --pp-tokens 1024 --ubatch 512
  --pp-no-logits --no-mtp --telemetry build/llama-cuda/q38ls-lm-boundary.jsonl`)
  -> Passed (8.4-20 s). Log `out/q38ls-lm-boundary.log`.
- Host recheck (no GPU): `llama-layer-streaming --check-telemetry
  build/llama-cuda/q38ls-lm-boundary.jsonl` -> exit 0 (15 events, 1 slot).
- Regression (GPU mutex): `tools/run-tests.ps1 -Suite boundary` -> 2/2 pass;
  `-Suite quick` -> 8/8 pass (boundary, lifecycle, scheduler, scheduler-256,
  pp512). Default-OFF `llama-cli` builds (no GPU).

Observed behavior
- `run_start` carries `schedule:"layer-major"` and `act_slab_bytes:41943040`
  (2 x [5120,1024] F32 = 40 MiB for the 1,024-token probe). The preflight
  prints `act slabs require 41943040 bytes (2 x 20971520); free VRAM
  21610102784, total 25650855936` before inference. The formula is
  `2 * n_embd * pp_tokens * 4`, which is 838,860,800 bytes (800 MiB) for the
  20,480-token envelope; this is an allocation size, not a VRAM-fit claim.
- `act_bind` events record the per-chunk slab offsets: chunk 0 -> slab A
  [0,10485760) + slab B [0,10485760); chunk 1 -> slab A [10485760,20971520)
  + slab B [10485760,20971520). The slices are non-aliasing (host validator
  proves it).
- The layer-0 package is copied once (one `copy_submit`/`copy_complete`,
  generation 1, 364,022,656 B) and both chunk computes reuse that one
  generation: two `layer_compute` events, chunk 0 (ubatch 1) then chunk 1
  (ubatch 2), same slot 0, same generation 1. No second copy, no eviction
  between the two chunks. KV/recurrent state is owned by the logical layer
  and written in-graph, never by a slot index.
- `phase_summary`: tokens 1024, ubatches 2, `graph_builds 0` (per-chunk graph
  sets were prebuilt; the timed region did no graph construction), compute
  ~241 ms, transfer ~2320 ms (shared-GPU noise), peak VRAM ~3.85 GiB.

Selected graph-binding mechanism (recorded per the task contract)
- Per-chunk prebuilt graph sets: each chunk's act pair is a pair of
  non-aliasing fixed-offset slices of the two slabs, bound at prebuild. The
  set key is `(mode, n_tokens, rs_z, n_outputs, chunk_id)`. Measured
  two-chunk probe footprint: `chunks=2 graph_sets=2 total_graphs=132
  act_slab_bytes=41943040 io_ctxs=2` (2 sets x 66 graphs; 2 io contexts).
- Rejected mechanism: a `ggml_view_2d` over a stable slab tensor. The
  scheduler's galloc calls `ggml_backend_view_init` on a view whose source
  has a backend buffer, which allocates a *separate* buffer for the view and
  defeats the stable-slab / non-aliasing semantics. Fixed-offset
  `ggml_backend_tensor_alloc` from the slab buffer is used instead (the same
  documented API the batch-major act pairs use).
- Host `--check-telemetry` now enforces, for `schedule == "layer-major"`:
  per-layer ascending chunk identity (0,1,2,...) and non-aliasing `act_bind`
  slices per slab. Both negative fixtures (out-of-order chunk; aliasing bind)
  are rejected with exit 1, so the checks are not vacuous.

Caveats: shared GPU (a foreign process held VRAM; timing is subject to
shared-GPU noise); source cache is best-effort cold (uncontrolled Windows file
cache); this is a one-layer, two-chunk boundary probe - full 64-layer PP, 20K
scale, and the PP->TG handoff are T-Q38LM-02..04.

### T-Q38LM-02: full two-chunk layer-major PP pass (done 2026-08-20)

A dedicated `llama_context::layer_major_pp` controller drives 1,024 PP
tokens (two 512-token chunks) through all 64 logical layers in layer-major
order (chunk 0 then chunk 1 for every layer before the next layer), with each
package copied once and reused across both chunks. This is a
scheduler-state / determinism check, not a quality or speedup claim.

Commands (workspace root, Git Bash; GPU runs under `tools/with-gpu-lock.ps1`):
- Build (no GPU): `cmake --build build/llama-cuda --config Release --target
  llama-layer-streaming --parallel 16` -> exit 0. Default-OFF build
  (`build/llama-cuda-off`) also compiles (the experimental path is gated out).
- Layer-major 1024 (GPU mutex): `ctest --test-dir build/llama-cuda -C Release
  -R layer-streaming-layer-major-1024 --output-on-failure` (runner:
  `--pp-schedule layer-major --pp-tokens 1024 --ubatch 512 --layer-slots 4
  --pp-no-logits --tg-tokens 1 --greedy --no-mtp --telemetry
  build/llama-cuda/q38ls-lm-1024.jsonl`) -> 2/2 pass (run ~16-36 s, host
  check ~0.07 s). Log `out/q38ls-lm1024-full.log`.
- Regression (GPU mutex): `ctest -R layer-streaming-(scheduler^|pp512^|layer-major-1024)`
  -> 8/8 pass; `tools/run-tests.ps1 -Suite quick` -> 8/8 pass. Batch-major and
  the existing CTest names are unchanged.
- Host negative fixtures (no GPU): a deliberately reordered-chunk trace and a
  duplicated-chunk trace both fail `--check-telemetry` with exit 1 ("layer-major
  chunk not ascending for layer"), so the layer-major invariants are not
  vacuous.

Observed behavior
- `phase_summary` (PP): tokens 1024, ubatches 2, `graph_builds 0`, 64
  layers_run, 60 evictions (4-slot lookahead), compute ~0.74 s, transfer
  ~31 s (shared-GPU noise, host-synchronous pageable copies). 128 PP
  `layer_compute` events: chunk 0 then chunk 1 for each of the 64 layers, no
  layer L+1 compute before both layer-L computes complete. Exactly 64 PP
  `copy_submit` events: each layer's package is copied once and consumed by
  both chunks under the same generation; the generation increments as the
  four slots are reused (layers 0-3 gen 1, 4-7 gen 2, ...).
- TG (1 token) uses the standard per-ubatch path and reuses the TG-u1 set
  exactly like batch-major (`graph_builds 0`). The one-token TG
  schedule-consistency check produces the same first greedy ID **286** under
  batch-major (`q38ls-bm-1024.jsonl`) and layer-major (`q38ls-lm-1024.jsonl`)
  for the same 1,024 PP tokens.

Design notes (recorded per the task contract)
- The controller creates one memory context per chunk and applies it in chunk
  order so the shared rec/KV state is current for each chunk's `find_set` /
  `set_inputs` (the prebuilt per-chunk sets were built against the identical
  applies). The recurrent `rs_z` is captured per chunk at apply time (chunk 0
  -> 0, chunk 1 -> -1) because `get_rs_z()` reads the shared rec memory that
  the next `apply()` overwrites; the controller re-resolves each chunk against
  the same `(rs_z, n_out, chunk)` tuple the prebuild used.
- The per-ubatch path (batch-major) is unchanged. Layer-major PP is rejected
  there as a routing error; layer-major TG (phase 1) reuses the TG-u1 set
  exactly like batch-major. Activation slabs swap only after every chunk of
  the current layer completes (fixed per-chunk slab slices, no aliasing).

Caveats: shared GPU (timing subject to shared-GPU noise); source cache is
best-effort cold (uncontrolled Windows file cache); this is a 2-chunk / 64-layer
PP determinism check - 20K scale, a 3-token TG, and the negative/final
regression are T-Q38LM-03..05.

### T-Q38LM-03 through T-Q38LM-05: 20K PP, 3-token TG, and regression closure (done 2026-08-20)

See "20K Layer-Major Evidence" above. The free-GPU run completed all 40 chunks
through every logical layer with legal generation reuse and then generated
three TG tokens from the same live state. Both telemetry validators accepted
the 4,113-event trace, and the full mutex-protected regression suite passed
19/19 targets. The default-OFF build remains successful. Raw measurements are
subject to uncontrolled Windows file-cache state and are not a speedup or
quality claim.

## Known gaps / risks (current)

- Foreign `deepseek_v4.exe` shared the GPU during earlier validation
  (~12.4 GiB VRAM held, high util), so those timing results are subject to
  shared-GPU noise. The completed 20K run started with the GPU idle; every
  trace still records observed free VRAM at `run_start`.
- `llama-cli --log-file` stalled with an empty log file on this build (two
  runs killed). Not task-owned (our runner writes its own JSONL telemetry),
  but recorded here: do not rely on llama-cli's file logger.
- CPU-only execution of this model is impractically slow (see above).
- With pageable mmap copy sources the copies are host-synchronous; the four-slot
  lookahead overlaps compute but the copies themselves still serialize on the
  copy stream. Recorded as observed behavior, not a claim.
- The CMake CTest entries bake `$ENV{Q38LS_MODEL_PATH}` at configure time; a
  reconfigure without that env var set rewrites the model path to empty and the
  GPU tests fail at arg parsing. Reconfigure with Q38LS_MODEL_PATH exported.

## Blocked / escalated

- (none) The T-Q38LS-04 `rs_z` variant escalation is resolved by T-Q38LS-04B.
